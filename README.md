# FaceRecognitionProject

![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()


In this project you'll dive into face recognition framework and train neural network for face recognition task, play with losses and metrics.

This basic notebook will give you 8/10 points, if completed fully. There are also additional features you might implement to get additional points. You may do additional tasks and receive additional points even if you didn't fully complete the basic notebook. This means you can choose which tasks to do. **Additional features that you might implement are listed in Telegram chat**.

We will train neural network on [CelebA dataset](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html).
